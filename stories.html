       <br><p id="pa">This Indian food guide is a cheat sheet for Indian restaurant menus. 
        It covers the most popular Indian dishes — what they are, how they’re served & more!
        I love Indian food. All Indian food. However, when I ask people what their favorite Indian dish is, the answer more often than not is “Chicken Tikka Masala.” 
        This has always bothered me a bit. Now, don’t get me wrong, Chicken Tikka Masala is AMAZING! In fact, if I had to pick one Indian dish to introduce to a non convert, 
        it would probably be Chicken Tikka Masala. But there is so much more to Indian food!
         The more I questioned people, the more I found out that it wasn’t that they didn’t like other Indian dishes, they simply felt intimidated by the names and did not understand them.  
         The irony here is that Indian food names are quite simple.  The dishes are usually named after the main components or where they come from. But given that fact, if I did not understand the language, I’d be confused too.
         So consider this my effort to make things right. Here’s a rundown on what you commonly find on a typical Indian restaurant menu. 
         Now next time when you go to your favorite Indian restaurant to enjoy a meal, use this guide to the most popular Indian dishes and order something outside of your comfort zone. 
         There’s a good chance you will be surprised to know how much goodness you were missing out on!
